# Supplemental Information: Well Log Reporting by State
	
The information found below is a representation of the best available data and well reporting requirements we were able to obtain while conducting this research. This is meant to serve as a guide and by no means should supersede any information presently obtained from local or state agencies. The tables for each state are comprised of the following columns:

**Records:** Number of total well records within the dataset

**Domestic:** Number of records within the dataset that are considered domestic

**Address:** Dataset has address information for wells Y/N (Yes/No)

**GPS:** Dataset has GPS (lat/lon) information for wells Y/N (Yes/No)

**PLSS:** Dataset has PLSS location information for wells Y/N (Yes/No)

**Updated:** The last update to the dataset prior to download for use within this analysis

**Reporting Start:** Year that state began requiring the reporting of well drilling.

**Suitable for RW:** Dataset is suitable for the RW method Y/N (Yes/No)

## Alabama

**Description**

These records are scanned paper documents and have not been digitized.  Unsuitable for GIS in present form

**Location Requirements**

Projections or roofs of adjacent building: 2 Feet, Secondary electrical services: 10 Feet, Primary electrical services: 75 Feet, Cess pool or sewage lagoon: 150 Feet, Septic tank or field lines: 100 Feet, Barnyard: 150 Feet

**Reporting Requirements**

ADEM Admin. Code R. 335-9-1-.03 (Revised May 1988) : (1) Every person desiring to drill a water well shall file with the Board, on a form furnished by the Board, a Notification of Intent to drill a well. This form shall be filed prior to the commencement of work.  (2) Every person who drills a well shall file a Certification of Completion on the form furnished by the Board within 30 days after completion of work. The board shall notify the local Health authorities within 7 days of the receipt thereof. 

**Notes**

[According to APH](http://www.adph.org/environmental/Default.asp?id=1262) Private wells serve about 800,000 in Alabama (20%).

## Alaska

**Description**

The well log database is designed for finding specific records and not bulk downloading locations of several, though the data is in digital form and could probably be obtained directly through the state.  It seems that a large number of wells in Alaska go unreported based on what reviewed materials.

**Location Requirements**

200 feet between public Non-Community Wells and on-site sewer systems

**Reporting Requirements**

"Upon completing the well construction, it's in your best interest, as a homeowner, to assure that the water well drilling log is submitted to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in order to record the information in WELTS. While water well contractors are required to submit this information to DNR, it is not always carried out. Failure to record this information in WELTS may lead to difficulties in future real estate transactions." [Source](https://dec.alaska.gov/eh/dw/dwp/private-wells.aspx)

[Link to Alaska best management practices - Construction of non-public water wells](https://dec.alaska.gov/eh/dw/dwp/private-wells.aspx#construct)

**Notes**

According to the Alaska Division of Environmental Health: The State of Alaska, Drinking Water Program, does not sample, test, or regulate the construction of private drinking water wells. In fact, the only local governments that regulate and have established standards for private water wells are the Municipality of Anchorage and the City of North Pole. Separation distances from septic systems are only enforced when septic is installed. [Source](https://dec.alaska.gov/eh/dw/dwp/private-wells.aspx)

## Arizona

**Description**

The Arizona Wells55 Database contains data on all known groundwater wells in the state. This data is readily usable for GIS work.

**Location Requirements**

All wells must be at least 100 feet from septic tanks or sewage disposal areas.

**Reporting Requirements**

R12-15-809. Notice of Intention to Drill A notice of intention to drill required to be filed pursuant to A.R.S. § 45-596 shall be signed by the owner or lessee of the property upon which the well is to be drilled. Historical Note Adopted effective March 5, 1984 (Supp. 84-2).

**Notes**

Wells are classified by exempt or non-exempt which are based on the pumping capacity of the well.  Wells that are capable of pumping less than 35 gallons per minute.

## Arkansas

**Description**

This database produces a table which can be copied and reconfigured for use in GIS.  It should be noted that latitude and longitude were input in reverse order for a few hundred records and must be switched.

**Location Requirements**

Cess Pools: 100 Feet, Leaching Pit: 100 Feet, Pit Privy: 100 Feet, Subsurface Seepage Tile: 100 Feet, Manure Piles: 100 Feet Septic Tank 100, Feet Sewers (Cast iron with water tight, leaded or mechanical joints): 50 Feet, Footing Drains (No connection to a sewer or a sump handling sewage): 10 Feet, Pump House Floor Drain (Cast iron with water tight joints and having free fall discharge to ground surface): 2 Feet

**Reporting Requirements**

‘Within ninety (90) days after a water well has been constructed or repaired, the constructor shall submit a report of construction to the Arkansas Water Well Construction Commission on such forms as are prescribed and furnished by the Commission. The date of construction and time of completion shall be the date and time the rig is removed or pulled off the bore hole or well. Reports must be legible, must supply all requested information applicable to the type of work done, and must contain the longitude and latitude of the well location.’

**Notes**

It is unclear when reporting was first required, however well logs spiked in 1988 and it is reasonable to suggest they were required somewhere between 1988-1991

## Colorado

**Description**

Full database includes denied permits as well as approved and constructed wells.  The 522,388 refers to all of the available permits including those denied.  The 215,828 wells refer to only those that were listed as constructed under the categories of ''domestic' and 'household use only'.

**Location Requirements**

"In most cases, exempt well permits limit the pumping rate to no
more than fifteen gallons per minute.    Household Use Only Wells - These types of well permits are issued for ordinary household uses in one single family dwelling and do not allow for outside water or livestock watering."

**Reporting Requirements**

It appears that requirements began in 1972 however this is not confirmed.

400.4: "The minimum horizontal setback distance of a water supply well from septic tanks, lift stations, and holding tanks is 60 feet." 

**Reporting Requirements**


**Notes**

A data file (CSV(zipped) 2.8MB) containing over 50,000 located wells is available for download. This file contains information on all wells in the database which could be geographically located. Data points have been located by GPS, by street address locations, and by using tax maps in combination with air photos so location accuracy varies. The database includes coordinates and descriptive information such as well yield, depth, overburden thickness, well use, and well type. This information is also portrayed on the Bedrock Groundwater Resources Basic Data Maps in PDF format. There is also a data file (CSV(zipped) 2.2MB) available containing over 65,000 unlocated wells that is available for download.  . . . .  Many setback reduction exemptions exist per section 400.3. Also, there is no specific language written in the law providing setback distances from underground storage tanks.

## Maryland

**Description**

Database obtained from public information request through the Maryland Department of the Environment. Native format is an Access database which can be converted into a geodatabase.  Each record corresponds to a log and so it is possible for several rows in the database to refer to the same physical well.  Metadata is included

**Reporting Requirements**

Drilling records seem to be required at the county level and are then forwarded on to the Maryland Department of Environment.  It is unclear when reporting began to be required across counties.  By looking at the data we can assume reporting began sometime in the 1940's.

Examples: 
-	Septic Systems: 100 feet
-	CAFOs: 100 feet

**Reporting Requirements**

Mandated by the state but handled at the county level: "North Carolina General Statute 87-97 requires counties to have programs for permitting, inspecting, and testing of private drinking water wells, which are constructed, repaired, or abandoned, on or after July 1, 2008. As a result, county health departments enforce state statutes and rules and receive technical and legal assistance from the Environmental Health Section. The program is designed to protect human health and groundwater quality by ensuring private drinking water wells are properly constructed, repaired, and abandoned."

## Rhode Island

**Description**

Rhode Island department of health took over well completion records in 2013.  Records are filed in paper form and as of 2017, they had about 45,000, around 6,000 of which have been scanned, however no digital database exists for them.  In 2013, locations started to require GPS coordinates, mostly addresses prior to that. The E-911 GIS layer and the Public Water Display layer can create a water service buffer for the state of Rhode Island.  Using negative inference, it is possible to identify all buildings in the state that by default must be on well water.  The E-911 layer is available [here](http://www.rigis.org/datasets/e-911-sites).  The water system layer is available [here](http://www.rigis.org/datasets/water-supply-districts/data).

## Utah

**Description**

The WRPOD shapefile is primarily used by the Division of Water Rights as a complete record of point of diversion locations. The shapefile  is generated nightly  from basic information in the Water Rights tabular database

**Location Requirements**

Rule R655-4-10.2 the licensee should also be familiar with local zoning ordinances, or county boards of health requirements which may limit or restrict the actual well location and construction in relationship to property/structure boundaries and existing or proposed concentrated sources of pollution or contamination such as septic tanks, drain fields, sewer lines, stock corrals, feed lots, etc. The licensee should also be familiar with the Utah Underground Facilities Act (Title 54, Chapter 8a of the Utah Code Annotated 1953 as amended) which requires subsurface excavators (including well drilling) to notify operators of underground utilities prior to any subsurface excavation.

**Reporting Requirements**

R655-4-4.1
“The well driller shall make certain that a valid authorization or approval to drill exists before engaging in regulated well drilling activity. Authorization to drill shall consist of a valid 'start card' based on any of the approvals listed below. Items 4.1.1 through 4.1.12 allow the applicant to contract with a well driller to drill, construct, deepen, replace, repair, renovate, clean, develop, or abandon exactly one well at each location listed on the start card or approval form. The drilling of multiple borings/wells at an approved location/point of diversion is not allowed without authorization from the state engineer's office. Most start cards list the date when the authorization to drill expires. If the expiration date has passed, the start card and authorization to engage in regulated drilling activity is no longer valid. If there is no expiration date on the start card, the driller must contact the state engineer's office to determine if the authorization to drill is still valid. When the work is completed, the permission to drill is terminated. Preauthorization or pre-approval of pump installation/repair work is not required."

## Vermont

**Description**

Private wells in this layer come from the Department of Environmental Conservation's Water Supply Data Composite. Managed by the Water Supply Division's Well Driller and Well Location Program, the database contains private well information submitted by Vermont licensed well drillers. Licensed well drillers have been required to submit well completion reports (well logs) to the state since 1966. Well tags have been required since 1986. NOTE: the data contained here is only as accurate as what was submitted - many wells were completed, but not reported, many reports have missing information, were recorded inaccurately or poorly located geographically.

“Within thirty (30) calendar days after the water well has been constructed, altered, or abandoned, the certified well driller shall submit a completion report to the Comissioner.  The date of construction and time of completion is the date and time the rig is removed or pulled off the borehole or well.  The certified well driller who actually performed the construction, alteration or abandonment of the well or provided the onsite supervision of the well construction, alteration or abandonment shall sign the completion report.  A master well driller is required to sign the completion report when a journeyman well driller conducts the on-site supervision and drilling."

**Notes**

While drilling records are required to be filed upon the drilling of a new, or the altering of an existing well, records appear to be filed at the county level.  The form does provide space for gps coordinates and these records have been required since at least 1984.  It is unclear how many records would exist in digital vs. paper format but there appears to be no online submission system indicating that paper copies are most likely to be the primary form of reporting.

## Wyoming

**Description**
	
Wyoming retains a general shapefile which was last updated in April 2016.  However, they have a queryable database which appears to be updated either daily or weekly.  The data can be exported to excel and can be converted into GIS format from there. The Wyoming state engineer's office makes note that most well locations are at a resolution of a plss quarter-quarter section (40-acres).  They make it very clear that these data should be considered for regional analysis and not mistaken for perfect positional accuracy.

**Location Requirements**

Rules are set forth by the [Water Well Minimum Construction Standards Document](https://2ce3bd20-a-84cef9ff-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/wyo.gov/seo/seo-files/WaterWellMinimumConstructionStandards.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7co227tWqpxiIq56mO0So0arkDIK3tAXxDxeu_-10wA07UiDNwPGn01U9dsfsqpuSHWtErx4W5fCQHgtmrIgTuJ2Q0_eatCUjJA4F_oYb66RDeNv2uoi7XisXYqgxSPkrRrXgJ7snho--zNq-rkwaxu_cFuramVEanIYDnDb3orjnS3GD8TcPQ2hMrpiLj4aw1hErq7bYYRdeAJPjKp9sxlnRvDNp8dmkDwcb4mO3-K1pV7Uo4N6IaoMxXZ9SzeLvHYMMRHG&attredirects=0)

**Reporting Requirements**

"W.S. 41-3-930: ""Any person who intends to acquire the right to beneficial use of any underground water in the state of Wyoming, shall, before commencing construction of any well or other means of obtaining underground water or performing any work in connection with construction or proposed appropriation of underground water or any manner utilizing the water for beneficial purposes, file with the state engineer an application for a permit to make the appropriation and shall not proceed with any construction or work until a permit is granted by the state engineer...""

From state engineers website: "The 1947 legislature enacted the State's first groundwater laws. Although the legislation was not extensive, it did for the first time, require the owners of any groundwater wells drilled in the state prior to April 1, 1947 to register their wells by a "Statement of Claim" with the office of the State Engineer. It also required that any new well proposed to be drilled after that date (except those for stock or domestic uses) must also be registered, and thus began the application of the prior appropriation system to groundwater use in Wyoming. Well filings made under a statement of claim could receive their priority based on the claimed date of completion of the well, going back as far in time as could be justified, while registrations of wells after April 1, 1947 would receive a priority as of the date their new filing was made with the State Engineer. A process for adjudication of wells was also included in the legislation"
