# Supplemental Information: Well Log Reporting by State
	
The information found below is a representation of the best available data and well reporting requirements we were able to obtain while conducting this research. This is meant to serve as a guide and by no means should supersede any information presently obtained from local or state agencies. The tables for each state are comprised of the following columns:

**Records:** Number of total well records within the dataset

**Domestic:** Number of records within the dataset that are considered domestic

**Address:** Dataset has address information for wells Y/N (Yes/No)

**GPS:** Dataset has GPS (lat/lon) information for wells Y/N (Yes/No)

**PLSS:** Dataset has PLSS location information for wells Y/N (Yes/No)

**Updated:** The last update to the dataset prior to download for use within this analysis

**Reporting Start:** Year that state began requiring the reporting of well drilling.

**Suitable for RW:** Dataset is suitable for the RW method Y/N (Yes/No)

## Alabama

**Description**

These records are scanned paper documents and have not been digitized.  Unsuitable for GIS in present form

**Location Requirements**

Projections or roofs of adjacent building: 2 Feet, Secondary electrical services: 10 Feet, Primary electrical services: 75 Feet, Cess pool or sewage lagoon: 150 Feet, Septic tank or field lines: 100 Feet, Barnyard: 150 Feet

**Reporting Requirements**

ADEM Admin. Code R. 335-9-1-.03 (Revised May 1988) : (1) Every person desiring to drill a water well shall file with the Board, on a form furnished by the Board, a Notification of Intent to drill a well. This form shall be filed prior to the commencement of work.  (2) Every person who drills a well shall file a Certification of Completion on the form furnished by the Board within 30 days after completion of work. The board shall notify the local Health authorities within 7 days of the receipt thereof. 

**Notes**

[According to APH](http://www.adph.org/environmental/Default.asp?id=1262) Private wells serve about 800,000 in Alabama (20%).

## Alaska

**Description**

The well log database is designed for finding specific records and not bulk downloading locations of several, though the data is in digital form and could probably be obtained directly through the state.  It seems that a large number of wells in Alaska go unreported based on what reviewed materials.

**Location Requirements**

200 feet between public Non-Community Wells and on-site sewer systems

**Reporting Requirements**

"Upon completing the well construction, it's in your best interest, as a homeowner, to assure that the water well drilling log is submitted to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in order to record the information in WELTS. While water well contractors are required to submit this information to DNR, it is not always carried out. Failure to record this information in WELTS may lead to difficulties in future real estate transactions." [Source](https://dec.alaska.gov/eh/dw/dwp/private-wells.aspx)

**Notes**

According to the Alaska Division of Environmental Health: The State of Alaska, Drinking Water Program, does not sample, test, or regulate the construction of private drinking water wells. In fact, the only local governments that regulate and have established standards for private water wells are the Municipality of Anchorage and the City of North Pole. Separation distances from septic systems are only enforced when septic is installed. [Source](https://dec.alaska.gov/eh/dw/dwp/private-wells.aspx)

## Arizona

**Description**

The Arizona Wells55 Database contains data on all known groundwater wells in the state. This data is readily usable for GIS work.

**Location Requirements**

All wells must be at least 100 feet from septic tanks or sewage disposal areas.

**Reporting Requirements**

R12-15-809. Notice of Intention to Drill A notice of intention to drill required to be filed pursuant to A.R.S. § 45-596 shall be signed by the owner or lessee of the property upon which the well is to be drilled. Historical Note Adopted effective March 5, 1984 (Supp. 84-2).

**Notes**

Wells are classified by exempt or non-exempt which are based on the pumping capacity of the well.  Wells that are capable of pumping less than 35 gallons per minute.

## Arkansas

**Description**

This database produces a table which can be copied and reconfigured for use in GIS.  It should be noted that latitude and longitude were input in reverse order for a few hundred records and must be switched.

**Location Requirements**

Cess Pools: 100 Feet, Leaching Pit: 100 Feet, Pit Privy: 100 Feet, Subsurface Seepage Tile: 100 Feet, Manure Piles: 100 Feet Septic Tank 100, Feet Sewers (Cast iron with water tight, leaded or mechanical joints): 50 Feet, Footing Drains (No connection to a sewer or a sump handling sewage): 10 Feet, Pump House Floor Drain (Cast iron with water tight joints and having free fall discharge to ground surface): 2 Feet

**Reporting Requirements**

‘Within ninety (90) days after a water well has been constructed or repaired, the constructor shall submit a report of construction to the Arkansas Water Well Construction Commission on such forms as are prescribed and furnished by the Commission. The date of construction and time of completion shall be the date and time the rig is removed or pulled off the bore hole or well. Reports must be legible, must supply all requested information applicable to the type of work done, and must contain the longitude and latitude of the well location.’

**Notes**

It is unclear when reporting was first required, however well logs spiked in 1988 and it is reasonable to suggest they were required somewhere between 1988-1991

## California

**Note:** California, in recent years, has made extraordinary efforts in tracing well locations and the information here is likely now out of date.

**Description**

Up to 2 million California residents are served either by private domestic wells or by water systems serving fewer than 15 service connections

**Location Requirements**

Animal enclosures / septic systems: 100 ft (http://waterboards.ca.gov/gama/docs/wellowner_guide.pdf)
