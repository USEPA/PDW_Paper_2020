# Census boundaries.                                        #

# Test #1: (1)	Housing change from 1990 â€“ 2000:  Realistic housing unit density change was 
# determined for block groups between 1990 and 2000 by identifying block groups which maintained 
# the exact same boundaries between census collection years and then finding the range of housing 
# unit density changes for these block groups. Due to the fact that census boundary files for 1990 
# and 2000 are slightly different, block groups were determined to be identical if they had less 
# than .1 percent change in land area between 1990 and 2000.

# unit density changes for these block groups. The boundary files for block groups in 2000 and 2010
# use the same spatial basis (2010 Tiger Line files), i.e. if they have not been redrawn, their
